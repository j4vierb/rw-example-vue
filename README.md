# rw-example

Here I learn how to use Services in VueJS without Axios to do API calls. Additionally I know how to do dinamyc routes using `@/router/index.js`, use `RouterLink` and `RouterDisplay` components. 

**note**: in `RouterLink` component you can use `v-bind:to="{name: 'defined-route', props: { propName: state.ex }}"`.
