# rw-example

With this project I learned how to use Services in VueJS, without Axios, to do API calls. Additionally, now I know how to do dinamyc routes using `@/router/index.js` and use `RouterLink` and `RouterDisplay` components. 

Also, with the second course I learned how to use `watchEffect`. In this case, the callback is executed when the reactive components change. Furthermore, I learn that `v-bind:to` in `RouterLink` has different parameters like `name` (the route to which will be directed), `params` (the data to the component) and `query` (that executes an instruction when the user clic's the link).
